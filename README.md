# Futuristic UI

## EVERYDAY RULES

1. Must be every 24 hours (doesn't have to be midnight of current timezone)
2. Must be posted on a public forum before the time is up (currently 2 pomosessions)
3. Must be new project (can reuse any code from previous projects)
4. Must be a visual interface (but can be static or an animated)
5. Must be a self-contained idea (can build on previous, but should be distinct)



## TODAY


## WIP
- [ ] BlurView (iOS version)
- [ ] not loving Glitch yet



## TODO



### LATER
- [ ] HelperLabels from Hexis
- [ ] Export / Screen recording
- [ ] Akira (fonts)
- [ ] Felix Color Palette v2 (Improved Light/Dark)
	- consider integrating systemColors:
		- primary, secondary...
		- labelColor, secondaryLabelColor, tertiaryLabelColor, and quaternaryLabelColor
			(labelColor offers most contrast, quarternary least)
- [ ] extrapolate best patterns to snippets
- [ ] comb through old projects to keep this MegaProject up to date 




## Roadmap

- Cyclical UI: day/night, week, seasons
