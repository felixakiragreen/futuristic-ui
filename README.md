# Futuristic UI

## EVERYDAY RULES

1. Must be every 24 hours (doesn't have to be midnight of current timezone)
2. Must be posted on a public forum before the time is up (currently 2 pomosessions)
3. Must be new project (can reuse any code from previous projects)
4. Must be a visual interface (but can be static or an animated)
5. Must be a self-contained idea (can build on previous, but should be distinct)
